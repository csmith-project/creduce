C-Reduce 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Prereqs:

On Ubuntu, all non-standard prerequisites can be installed like this:

  sudo apt-get install indent astyle delta libbenchmark-timer-perl \
    libexporter-lite-perl libfile-which-perl libregexp-common-perl

On other systems, install these packages either manually or using the
package manager:

GNU Indent
  http://www.gnu.org/software/indent/

astyle: 
  http://astyle.sourceforge.net/

Berkeley delta:
  http://delta.tigris.org/

Perl modules
  Benchmark::Timer
  Exporter::Lite
  File::Which
  Regexp::Common

For example, (perhaps as root):

  cpan -i 'Benchmark::Timer'
  cpan -i 'Exporter::Lite'
  cpan -i 'File::Which'
  cpan -i 'Regexp::Common'

Building and installing C-Reduce and the clang_delta plugin

1. Download, build, and install the latest LLVM/Clang from their
repository:

  http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#checkout

Note: If you're having trouble with their trunk, you can use
LLVM/Clang 3.0 instead, but in that case you'll have to grab an older
C-Reduce tagged "creduce-1.0.0".

2. Build the C-Reduce software distribution:

  # cd to where you want to build the package, then:
  configure
  make
  make install

The `configure' script was generated by GNU Autoconf, and therefore
accepts the usual options for naming the installation directories,
choosing the compilers you want to use, and so on.  `configure --help'
summarizes the command-line options.

If LLVM/Clang is not in your search path, you can tell the `configure'
script where to find LLVM/Clang:

  # Use the LLVM/Clang tree rooted at /opt/llvm
  configure --with-llvm=/opt/llvm

Note that assertions are disabled by default.  To enable assertions:

  configure --enable-trans-assert
